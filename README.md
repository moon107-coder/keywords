<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5247cc68-aed6-43d5-a6b8-820267859793">

  <b>*Layer 7 : Application Layer</b> - The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. <br>
  
  <b>*Layer 6 : Presentation Layer</b> - The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compresses                   data so it is received correctly on the other end.<br>
  
 <b>*Layer 5 : Session Layer</b> - The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices.<br>
 
  <b>*Layer 4 : Transport Layer </b>- The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end.<br>
  
 <b>*Layer 3 : Networking Layer </b>- The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the                       receiving end.<br>
 
 <b>*Layer 2 : Data-Link-Layer </b>- The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network.<br>

 blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
